    <!-- Differnt Terms  -->
    
    <!-- Command Line  -->
    <!-- any interface that is used by entering textual commands (gen. Windows centric) -->

    <!-- Terminal 
        - this is a type of command line (gen. Mac centric ) -->

    
    <!-- console
    a command line interface used to work with you computer   -->


    <!-- Shell -->
    <!-- a program runing on terminal -->

    <!-- Bash  -->
    <!-- a computer shell on Mac Os / linux -->


    <!-- z-shell  -->
    <!-- another shell (defult) -->

<!-- Terminal: This originally referred to a physical device, like a keyboard and monitor, used to interact with computers. Today, a "terminal" generally refers to a software application (like Terminal on macOS, GNOME Terminal on Linux, or Command Prompt on Windows) that allows users to interact with the command-line interface. In modern usage, it's the application you open to enter commands. -->

<!-- Console: Historically, the "console" referred to the main terminal used for administrative tasks on older computers. In modern computing, "console" is sometimes used synonymously with "terminal" but is also used to describe system administration interfaces (like the Windows Console) or browser developer tools (which include a console for JavaScript). -->

<!-- Command Line: This refers specifically to the text-based interface where commands are typed and executed. It's a part of the terminal where you enter commands, and it interprets these commands through a shell (like Bash or Zsh on Unix-based systems, or PowerShell on Windows). -->


<!-- Terminal: The program or app that opens the command line.
Console: Sometimes synonymous with terminal, but also refers to system or admin interfaces.
Command Line: The actual interface within the terminal where commands are typed and executed. -->




<!-- A shell is a program that provides an interface between the user and the operating system, allowing the user to execute commands, run programs, and manage system tasks. When you type commands in a terminal or command line, the shell interprets these commands and interacts with the underlying operating system to execute them. -->
