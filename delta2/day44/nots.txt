Important Considerations:
Placement: The error-handling middleware must come after all other middleware and routes in your app. This is because middleware and route handlers are processed in order.
Calling next(err): You call next(err) within any middleware or route handler when an error occurs, and it will automatically jump to the error-handling middleware.
This structure ensures that if an error occurs anywhere in the request lifecycle, the error will be handled appropriately without crashing the server.




##stack trace
In Node.js (and JavaScript in general), a stack trace is a report that provides details about the call stack (the sequence of function calls that led to the error) at the moment when an error occurred. It helps you trace back the source of an error by showing the path through the code that was taken before the error was thrown.

A stack trace usually includes:

The error message that describes what went wrong.
The call stack showing the sequence of functions and the file/line number where the error occurred.

How to Access the Stack Trace:
When you throw an error, the stack trace is automatically attached to the error object. By logging err.stack, you can see the trace.ðŸ‘‡
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
  console.error(err.stack); // Prints the full stack trace
  res.status(500).send("Internal Server Error");
});

function asyncWrap(fn) {

    fn(req, res, next).catch((err) => {
      next(err);
    })

}vs const asyncWrap = (fn) => {
  return (req, res, next) => {
    Promise.resolve(fn(req, res, next)).catch(next);
  };
};
