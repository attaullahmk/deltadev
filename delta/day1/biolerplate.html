    <!-- A markup language is a way to add notes or instructions to a document to tell computers how to display or structure the content. These instructions are usually written using special tags or symbols around the text. -->


    <!-- For example, in HTML (used to create web pages) -->


    <!-- The term markup refers to a system for annotating or structuring -->\
    <!-- **Annotating** means adding extra information, notes, or labels to a piece of text, code, or content to describe, explain, or structure it. 

    For example:
    - In documents, annotations can include comments or highlights to clarify the content.
    - In programming, **markup languages** like HTML use tags to annotate text and define its structure or presentation.
    
    ### Example in Markup Language (HTML):
    ```html
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
    ```
    Here:
    - `<p>` is the **markup** that tells the browser "This is a paragraph."
    - `This is a paragraph.` is the content being annotated.
    
    In simple terms, markup helps computers understand how to display or organize information.




<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p> tells the computer that "This is a paragraph." -->

<p>This is another paragraph.</p>

<!-- So, a markup language is just a way to label or organize parts of a document so that computers can understand how to handle or show it. -->
